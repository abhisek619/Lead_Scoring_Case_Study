Lead Scoring Case Study
by Abhishek Rathore, Abhisek Kundu, Abhradeep Chandra Paul

X Education aims to improve its 30% lead conversion rate by identifying 'Hot Leads'. These high-potential leads enable the sales team to focus on the most promising prospects, thus improving efficiency. 
Provided with a dataset of 9000 past leads, including attributes like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, and Total Visits, need to build a predictive model to assign lead scores. The goal is to elevate the lead conversion rate to around 80%. 
Managing categorical variables with 'Select' values is crucial, as they represent null entries and can impact the model's performance if not handled properly.

Logistic Regression will be used for this case Study.

Logistic Regression Workflow: 

> Data Preparation,
> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
> Dummy Variable Creation,
> Train-Test Split,
>Feature Scaling,
> Correlation Analysis,
> Model Building (using Recursive Feature Elimination - RFE),
> Model Evaluation,
> Threshold Tuning,
> Precision and Recall Evaluation,
> Making Predictions on Test Set.
